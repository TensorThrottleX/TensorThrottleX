## TensorThrottleX

This space is where I work through ideas by building and observing.

Most of what lives here starts from a simple question — *what happens if I try this?* — and turns into small, focused pieces of work: demos, visualizations, and technical notes. The emphasis is on understanding behavior, not polishing products.

You’ll find:
- concise implementations of specific ideas
- explorations around data, ML, and systems
- outputs and observations documented alongside code

Updates here are irregular and driven by curiosity rather than a schedule.  
Each repository stands on its own and reflects a point in that process.
